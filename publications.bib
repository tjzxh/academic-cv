   abstract = {<p>Turning behaviour is one of the most challenging driving manoeuvres that take place at intersections. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are often overly conservative in these scenarios as they compromised to others’ behaviour to realize behavioural consistency. This paper proposes an intended cooperative motion planning (ICMP) that can actively predict the intentions of interacting participants. This helps achieve socially compliant cooperation and enables each vehicle to converge upon a set of consistent behaviours. The ICMP framework divides the integrated driving process into two related modules: prediction and planning. These modules are integrated using the mechanism of intended cooperation, which first introduces the criteria for a cooperative response and then maps them in the motion planning space. The prediction module applies a Gaussian mixture model to learn human drivers’ behaviour to determine conflict points, which helps to narrow down the solution spaces. In the planning module, paths are represented by quartic Bézier curves and speed is modelled as a polynomial function. Optimizations can then be used that maximize the efficiency and smoothness for path planning, and comfort and efficiency for speed planning. The test results show that ICMP‐based AVs had consistent interactions with other vehicles. Moreover, when compared with a potential field‐based method, the ICMP‐based method had better performance in terms of safety, comfort and efficiency, especially when interacting with multiple oncoming vehicles.</p>},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a hierarchical framework integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and rule-based methods for multi-lane autonomous driving. We define an instantaneous desired speed (IDS) to mimic the common motivation for higher speed in different traffic situations as an intermediate action. High-level DRL is utilized to generate IDS directly, while the low-level rule-based policies including car following (CF) models and three-stage lane changing (LC) models are governed by the common goal of IDS. Not only the coupling between CF and LC behaviors is captured by the hierarchy, but also utilizing the benefits from both DRL and rule-based methods like more interpretability and learning ability. Owing to the decomposition and combination with rule-based models, traffic flow operations can be taken into account for individually controlled automated vehicles (AVs) with an extension of traffic flow adaptive (TFA) strategy through exposed critical parameters. A comprehensive evaluation for the proposed framework is conducted from both the individual and system perspective, comparing with a pure DRL model and widely used rule-based model IDM with MOBIL. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

   abstract = {String stability plays a crucial role in regulating traffic flow, as traffic oscillation can be triggered by string instability in the car-following (CF) behavior. Although studies over the past decades have provided various methods for analyzing string stability of analytical CF models, no studies have focused on neural network (NN) based CF models despite the fact that these models have exhibited remarkable performance in learning realistic driving behavior in the recent literature. This paper fills this gap by proposing a generic theoretical framework for analyzing the string stability of NN-based CF models through an Estimation-Approximation-Derivation-Calculation process (referred to as EADC framework). Within the framework, we first estimate the steady states of NN-based CF models by solving the corresponding optimization model and obtain the smooth approximation of the NN-based models for linearization, based on which the transfer function is constructed. We then derive the general stability criteria for two commonly used classes of NN in CF modeling, i.e., feedforward NN-based CF models with basic input and recurrent NN-based CF models with multi-step historical information. The string stability is thus obtained by calculating the partial derivatives through the automatic differentiation method. As two case studies, we apply the proposed stability analysis framework on two typical NN-based CF models, the Mo-MLP model (Mo et al., 2021) and the Huang-LSTM model (Huang et al., 2018), and obtained the complete consistency between the theoretical results and the simulation results for both models, which demonstrates the soundness of the proposed EADC framework. Moreover, we discuss the applicability of the proposed EADC stability analysis framework in the emerging era of connected and autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence.},

   abstract = {The stochastic fundamental diagram (SFD), which describes the stochasticity of the macroscopic relations of traffic flow, plays a crucial role in understanding the uncertainty of traffic flow evolution and developing robust traffic control strategies. Although many efforts have been made to reproduce the SFD via various methods, few studies have focused on the analytical modeling of the SFD, particularly linking the macroscopic relations with microscopic behaviors. This study fills this gap by proposing a general micro-macroscopic modeling approach, which uses probabilistic leader–follower behavior to derive the macroscopic relations of a platoon and is referred to as the leader–follower conditional distribution-based stochastic traffic modeling (LFCD-STM) framework. Specifically, we first define a conditional probability distribution of speed for the leader‒follower pair according to Brownian dynamics, which is proven to be a general representation of the longitudinal interaction and compatible with classical car-following models. As a result, we can describe the joint distribution of vehicle speeds of the platoon through Markov chain modeling and further derive the macroscopic relations (e.g., the mean flow‒density relation and its variance) under equilibrium conditions. On the basis of this general micro-macroscopic framework, we utilize the maximum entropy approach to theoretically derive the SFD model, in which we provide a specific conditional distribution for longitudinal interaction and thus solve the analytical functions of the mean and variance of FD. The performance of the maximum entropy-based SFD model is thoroughly validated with the NGSIM I-80, US-101 and HighD datasets. The high consistency between the theoretical results and empirical results demonstrates the soundness of the LFCD-STM framework and the maximum entropy-based SFD model. Finally, the proposed SFD model has practical implications for promoting smoother driving behaviors to suppress stochasticity and improve traffic flow.},

   abstract = {The integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into existing traffic of human-driven vehicles (HVs) poses significant challenges in modeling and optimizing mixed traffic flow. Existing research on the impacts of AVs often neglects the stochastic nature of traffic flow that gets further complicated by the introduction of AVs, and mainly relies on unrealistic assumptions, such as oversimplified headway or specific car-following (CF) models. The under-utilization of empirical AV datasets further exacerbates these issues, raising concerns about the realism and applicability of existing findings. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel data-driven framework to model the stochastic fundamental diagram (SFD) of mixed traffic flow using AV trajectory datasets. Specifically, we learn the CF behavior of different leader–follower pairs (HV following AV, HV following HV, AV following HV, AV following AV) from data, unified by a conditional distribution, using the mixture density network (MDN). By formulating the platoon as a joint distribution through Markov chain modeling and incorporating all possible platoon arrangements, we then derive the SFD of mixed traffic flow. Using the NGSIM I-80 dataset, which enables aggregating the empirical fundamental diagram, we validate the proposed framework by demonstrating high consistency with the empirical result. We then apply the framework to the Waymo dataset to evaluate the impact of real-world AVs on traffic flow. The results indicate that larger AV penetration rates lead to decreased mean capacity and critical density while reducing capacity uncertainty, due to the conservative yet stable behavior of current AVs. Overall, this work establishes a general probabilistic modeling framework for mixed traffic flow, enabling the input of real-world AV trajectory datasets and output of the SFD under given AV penetration rates and AV spatial distributions. The proposed framework further facilitates assessing and comparing mixed traffic management strategies, with significant implications for future traffic system design and policy-making.},

   abstract = {Automated vehicles (AVs) are deemed to be the key element for the intelligent transportation system in the future. Many studies have been made to improve AVs’ ability of environment recognition and vehicle control, while the attention paid to decision making is not enough and the existing decision algorithms are very preliminary. Therefore, a framework of the decision-making training and learning is put forward in this paper. It consists of two parts: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training program and the high-fidelity virtual simulation environment. Then the basic microscopic behavior, car-following (CF), is trained within this framework. In addition, theoretical analysis and experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed reward functions for accelerating training using DRL. The results show that on the premise of driving comfort, the efficiency of the trained AV increases 7.9% and 3.8% respectively compared to the classical adaptive cruise control models, intelligent driver model and constant-time headway policy. Moreover, on a more complex three-lane section, we trained an integrated model combining both CF and lane-changing behavior, with the average speed further growing 2.4%. It indicates that our framework is effective for AV's decision-making learning.},

   abstract = {Car-following (CF) and lane-changing (LC) behaviors are two basic movements in traffic flow which are generally modeled separately in the literature, and thus the interaction between the two behaviors may be easily ignored in separated models and lead to unrealistic traffic flow description. In this paper, we adopt a deep learning model, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, to model the two basic behaviors simultaneously. By only observing the position information of the six vehicles surrounding the subject vehicle, the LSTM can extract the significant features that influence the CF and LC behaviors automatically and predict the vehicles behaviors with time-series data and memory effects. In addition, we propose a hybrid retraining constrained (HRC) training method to further optimize the LSTM model. With the I-80 trajectory data of NGSIM dataset we train and test the HRC LSTM model, while the results show that HRC LSTM model can accurately estimate CF and LC behaviors simultaneously with low longitudinal trajectories error and high LC prediction accuracy compared with the classical models. We also evaluate the transferability of the proposed model with the US101 dataset and a good transferability result is obtained as well.},
