abstract: The integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into existing traffic of human-driven
  vehicles (HVs) poses significant challenges in modeling and optimizing mixed traffic
  flow. Existing research on the impacts of AVs often neglects the stochastic nature
  of traffic flow that gets further complicated by the introduction of AVs, and mainly
  relies on unrealistic assumptions, such as oversimplified headway or specific car-following
  (CF) models. The under-utilization of empirical AV datasets further exacerbates
  these issues, raising concerns about the realism and applicability of existing findings.
  To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel data-driven framework
  to model the stochastic fundamental diagram (SFD) of mixed traffic flow using AV
  trajectory datasets. Specifically, we learn the CF behavior of different leaderâ€“follower
  pairs (HV following AV, HV following HV, AV following HV, AV following AV) from
  data, unified by a conditional distribution, using the mixture density network (MDN).
  By formulating the platoon as a joint distribution through Markov chain modeling
  and incorporating all possible platoon arrangements, we then derive the SFD of mixed
  traffic flow. Using the NGSIM I-80 dataset, which enables aggregating the empirical
  fundamental diagram, we validate the proposed framework by demonstrating high consistency
  with the empirical result. We then apply the framework to the Waymo dataset to evaluate
  the impact of real-world AVs on traffic flow. The results indicate that larger AV
  penetration rates lead to decreased mean capacity and critical density while reducing
  capacity uncertainty, due to the conservative yet stable behavior of current AVs.
  Overall, this work establishes a general probabilistic modeling framework for mixed
  traffic flow, enabling the input of real-world AV trajectory datasets and output
  of the SFD under given AV penetration rates and AV spatial distributions. The proposed
  framework further facilitates assessing and comparing mixed traffic management strategies,
  with significant implications for future traffic system design and policy-making.
