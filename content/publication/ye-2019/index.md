abstract: "Automated vehicles (AVs) are deemed to be the key element for the intelligent
  transportation system in the future. Many studies have been made to improve AVs’
  ability of environment recognition and vehicle control, while the attention paid
  to decision making is not enough and the existing decision algorithms are very preliminary.
  Therefore, a framework of the decision-making training and learning is put forward
  in this paper. It consists of two parts: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training
  program and the high-fidelity virtual simulation environment. Then the basic microscopic
  behavior, car-following (CF), is trained within this framework. In addition, theoretical
  analysis and experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed reward functions
  for accelerating training using DRL. The results show that on the premise of driving
  comfort, the efficiency of the trained AV increases 7.9% and 3.8% respectively compared
  to the classical adaptive cruise control models, intelligent driver model and constant-time
  headway policy. Moreover, on a more complex three-lane section, we trained an integrated
  model combining both CF and lane-changing behavior, with the average speed further
  growing 2.4%. It indicates that our framework is effective for AV's decision-making
  learning."
