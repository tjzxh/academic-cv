abstract: The stochastic fundamental diagram (SFD), which describes the stochasticity
  of the macroscopic relations of traffic flow, plays a crucial role in understanding
  the uncertainty of traffic flow evolution and developing robust traffic control
  strategies. Although many efforts have been made to reproduce the SFD via various
  methods, few studies have focused on the analytical modeling of the SFD, particularly
  linking the macroscopic relations with microscopic behaviors. This study fills this
  gap by proposing a general micro-macroscopic modeling approach, which uses probabilistic
  leader–follower behavior to derive the macroscopic relations of a platoon and is
  referred to as the leader–follower conditional distribution-based stochastic traffic
  modeling (LFCD-STM) framework. Specifically, we first define a conditional probability
  distribution of speed for the leader‒follower pair according to Brownian dynamics,
  which is proven to be a general representation of the longitudinal interaction and
  compatible with classical car-following models. As a result, we can describe the
  joint distribution of vehicle speeds of the platoon through Markov chain modeling
  and further derive the macroscopic relations (e.g., the mean flow‒density relation
  and its variance) under equilibrium conditions. On the basis of this general micro-macroscopic
  framework, we utilize the maximum entropy approach to theoretically derive the SFD
  model, in which we provide a specific conditional distribution for longitudinal
  interaction and thus solve the analytical functions of the mean and variance of
  FD. The performance of the maximum entropy-based SFD model is thoroughly validated
  with the NGSIM I-80, US-101 and HighD datasets. The high consistency between the
  theoretical results and empirical results demonstrates the soundness of the LFCD-STM
  framework and the maximum entropy-based SFD model. Finally, the proposed SFD model
  has practical implications for promoting smoother driving behaviors to suppress
  stochasticity and improve traffic flow.
