abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical framework integrating deep reinforcement
  learning (DRL) and rule-based methods for multi-lane autonomous driving. We define
  an instantaneous desired speed (IDS) to mimic the common motivation for higher speed
  in different traffic situations as an intermediate action. High-level DRL is utilized
  to generate IDS directly, while the low-level rule-based policies including car
  following (CF) models and three-stage lane changing (LC) models are governed by
  the common goal of IDS. Not only the coupling between CF and LC behaviors is captured
  by the hierarchy, but also utilizing the benefits from both DRL and rule-based methods
  like more interpretability and learning ability. Owing to the decomposition and
  combination with rule-based models, traffic flow operations can be taken into account
  for individually controlled automated vehicles (AVs) with an extension of traffic
  flow adaptive (TFA) strategy through exposed critical parameters. A comprehensive
  evaluation for the proposed framework is conducted from both the individual and
  system perspective, comparing with a pure DRL model and widely used rule-based model
  IDM with MOBIL. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
