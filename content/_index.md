      title: About Me
      text: |-
         I am a researcher passionate about understanding the complex interactions between humans, vehicles, and intelligent systems in traffic environments. My work lies at the intersection of transportation science, data-driven modeling, and autonomous driving, where I seek to uncover the fundamental principles that govern both microscopic driver behavior and macroscopic traffic dynamics.

      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
         My research lies at the intersection of traffic flow theory, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence in transportation systems. I am particularly interested in how microscopic driving behaviors translate into macroscopic traffic dynamics, and how emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles reshape the complexity of modern mobility systems.
         
         I have published multiple papers in leading journals such as Transportation Research Part C and Communications in Transportation Research. My publications have collectively received over **450 citations**.

         My contributions span three core areas:
         ## Traffic Flow Theory and Complex Systems

         I develop analytical and data-driven frameworks to capture the stochastic nature of traffic. Notably, my recent studies on the Stochastic Fundamental Diagram (SFD) establish a general micro-macroscopic modeling approach, bridging probabilistic driver interactions with large-scale flow properties.
         ## Autonomous Driving and Its Impacts on Traffic

         I investigate the decision-making, planning, and stability of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic. My works include deep reinforcement learningâ€“based behavior models, cooperative motion planning at intersections, and hierarchical multi-lane driving frameworks. These studies not only explore how AVs operate individually but also how they influence traffic flow collectively.
         ## Artificial Intelligence in Transportation Research

         I apply and advance machine learning techniques to better model and evaluate transportation systems. Specifically, I use deep learning to reproduce and improve car-following and lane-changing behaviors, providing a more accurate representation of human driving. In addition, I apply reinforcement learning to autonomous driving decision-making, enabling AVs to navigate complex traffic scenarios and learn cooperative strategies in simulation environments.
